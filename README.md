# IntoTech 2017
## Arduino Workshop
Let’s break the ice and get started in the makers’ movement by assembling a pre-designed hardware project from scratch! Come join as as we hit the ground running by prototyping your very own electronics project using Arduino and C++. No electronics or programming knowledge is required! 

Requirements: Please bring along a laptop. You don’t need to have any software preinstalled, however please download the [Arduino installer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) ahead of the workshop. We recommend listening to the The IoT Talk from Jamie happening directly before this workshop, as they are connected! 

This workshop is supported with material by [Conrad Electronics](https://www.conrad.at/).

### Prerequisites
These items are used for this workshop:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- DHT Library (should come with the Arduino IDE)
  - Learn about libraries and how to install them [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc2)

### Parts shopping list (to build at home if you want)
- 1 [16x2 Character LCD Display](https://vetco.net/products/16x2-character-lcd-display)
- 1 [400-point breadboard](https://vetco.net/products/400-point-breadboard) 
- 1 [Arduino-compatible Pro Micro*](https://vetco.net/products/arduino-compatible-pro-micro) 
  - *This Arduino requires soldering the header pins to the Arduino
- 1 [10k trim pot](https://vetco.net/products/10k-1-2w-25-turn-trim-potentiometer)
  - Note: this model is a 25-turn, versus the lower-turn number trim pots we used in the demo; either is fine, you just turn one more than the other--the important thing is is that it's 10k (20k would also work)
- 1 [330 Ohm resistor](https://vetco.net/products/330-ohm-1-4-watt-resistor)
  - Note: this model is a 1/4 watt, but you could use a smaller wattage if available; the LCD we're using wants about 300 Ohms
- 1 [DHT22 sensor](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Adafruit/385/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsMyYRRhGMFNiK6mi%2f0qhAsScidaIcRRdw%3d)
  - DHT11 would work as well, but isn't as accurate
- 1 [22k Ohm resistor](https://vetco.net/products/22k-ohm-1-4-watt-resistor) for use with DHT22
- 1 [USB to micro USB cable](https://vetco.net/products/1-micro-usb-cable-a-usb-to-micro-usb-b) 
- 2 [male-male jumper jumper wire packs](https://vetco.net/products/7-male-male-rainbow-breadboard-jumper-wire-for-arduino-10-pack)
  - Can also be purchased [here](http://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/MikroElektronika/MIKROE-513/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMuCISx1W3tuzqgZjGmk8QdS)

### Resources
- [Glyphduino library](http://rastating.github.io/Glyphduino/) - library with pre-made glyphs
- [Customer character generator](http://fusion94.org/lcdchargen/) - make your own custom glyphs in a web UI and get the code
